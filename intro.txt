node js is a runtime-server environment
node js is a javascript running on the javascript
it can conect with databases but javascript cannot connect with the databases
it uses chrome's v8 engine to execute the code 
node js is used mostly used for api: fast as compare to others
written in c++ and js and c

html, css , js are runned on client side and node js is runned on server side 
client side and server side can communicate through API's

node js provides data to v8 engine and then v8 engine provides that data to chrome which then executes it on screen
v8 engine is written in c++

What node js developer actually do ?
1. make apis
2. connecting server with client
3. making api for web, android, ios, etc..
4. making website


basically node js takes data from file server or we can say any database and then provide it to server and then server provides that data to web app or mobile app


npm= node package manager 

to run on command line
we can simplay write node -v
then node 
then write commands 

undefined means there is no code returned 

to run any node js file on terminal :- node index

both console.log , first run in browser is browser's command and not node js command
but one which is runned in any command shell is a node's command


fundamentals of node js: there is no conditionals or loops and arrays in node js , because these are of js 


nodemon :- node js is multi-threaded , can connect with multiple applications

node modules contains all the dependencies which are downloaded like express and we can use these folders whenever i want
