// middleware - works as middle man which basically helps to validate the things before doing the whole process
// if the request is not validated by the middleware then the whole request is sent back to the client before sending it to user

// there are multiple middlewares in any website - basically prevents us from hacking or any illegal usage of the website

//middleware functions are functions that have acces to the req, res , next = next middleware is used to send the response to next middleware if authorised
